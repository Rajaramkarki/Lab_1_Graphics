# Welcome to Graphics Labworks!

This repo contains all the labworks conducted on Computer Graphics (COMP 343). All the lab works are done in C# using OpenTK as the graphics library. The implementation might not be as good but it does the job. It has following projects.



## Lab 1 - Creating a Flag of Nepal

A flag of Nepal was created solely with the help of graphcis library and primitive shapes. 

## Lab 2 - Implementing Bresenham and DDA Line Drawing Algorithm
1. Implement Digital Differential Analyzer Line drawing algorithm.
2.  Implement Bresenham Line Drawing algorithm for both slopes(|m|<1 and |m|>=1).

## Lab 3 - Implementing Mid Point Ellipse and Circle Drawing Algorithm
1.  Write a Program to implement mid- point Circle Drawing Algorithm
2.  Write a Program to implement mid- point Ellipse Drawing Algorithm

## Lab 4 - Program to Implement 2D Transformation
1.  Write a Program to implement:
		a.  2D Translation
		b.  2D Rotation
		c.  2D Scaling
		d.  2D Reflection
		e.  2D Shearing
		
> **Note:** For doing these transformations, a triangle was taken.

## Lab 5 - Implementing Cohen-Sutherland Line Clipping, Cohen-Hodgeman Polygon Clipping Algorithms and implement 3D transformations
1.  Implement Cohen Sutherland Line Clipping algorithm
2.  Implement Sutherland Hodgemann polygon clipping algorithm
3.  Write a Program to Implement:
		a.  3D Translation  
		b.  3D Rotation
		c.  3D Scaling

> **Note:** To perform 3D transformations, a cube is considered.
